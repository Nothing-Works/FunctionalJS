# Referential Transparency

    - An expression is called **referentially transparent** if it can be replaced with its value without the impact on the program's behavior.

- Definitions
- Expression : is a combination of constants, variables, operators and functions that is interpreted and computed to produce another value.
  ```javascript
  const expression1 = 1 + 2;
  const expression2 = expression1 + 20;
  const expression3 = 1 * (2 + 3) * expression1 + 20;
  ```
- Value : is a numerical quantity that is assigned or is determined by calculation or measurement.
  - Values are semantically transparent. Values are meant to be available to you, open for you to see them.
- Transparent
  - free from pretense or deceit
  - easily detected or seen through
  - readily understood
- Referential : is of, containing, or constituting a reference. (especially, **pointing** to or involving a referent)
